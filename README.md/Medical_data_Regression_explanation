# Here I gonna explore dataset that include some informations about (smokers and non-smokers), I need to find strong correlations 
# And then use (Linear model) to deal with this dataset 
# First I gonna check if my dataset include any (null values), it seems that this dataset is complete
# Now I gonna do simple preprocessing, so I import (LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder)
# I use (LabelEncoder) to (drop duplicates from sex column) and change this column into numerical values
# I do this same with (smoker column) and also with region column
# My (region column) get numbers for each region, its not so good because they have no correlation, but its ok for now
