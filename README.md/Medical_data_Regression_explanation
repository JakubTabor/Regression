# Here I gonna explore dataset that include some informations about (smokers and non-smokers), I need to find strong correlations 
# And then use (Linear model) to deal with this dataset 
# First I gonna check if my dataset include any (null values), it seems that this dataset is complete
# Now I gonna do simple preprocessing, so I import (LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder)
# I use (LabelEncoder) to (drop duplicates from sex column) and change this column into numerical values
# I do this same with (smoker column) and also with region column
# My (region column) get numbers for each region, its not so good because they have no correlation, but its ok for now
# Then I look at correlation of each column in relation to (charges column), I can see that (smoker cloumn) have the strongest correlation
# I also (sort values) from the lowest to the highest, now I gonna explore the correlation in detail using different graph plots
# First I visualize all correlations on (subplots), for better visuality
# Then I visualize distribution of charges for (smokers and no-smokers), I can clearly see that smokers spent more on treatment
# (no-smokers) spent from (0 - 20 000) and (smokers) spent from (10 000 - 50 000) then charges are decreasing
# Now we are gonna look (number of smokers and no-smokers) according to sex
# We can notice that the number of smoking mens is higher than woman smokers, also non-smkoer womans are in majority
# Now we are gonna see, how look charges for (smoking womens and non-smoking womens), I use to do it (Box plot)
# We can see that smokers womes spent from (20 000 - 40 000) and non-smoker womens spent from (5 000 - 10 000)
# Then I plot on graph charges of (smoking mens and non-smoking mens) on a (Box plot)
# Charges are similar to (womens charges) from (5 000 - 10 000) non-smokers and (20 000 - 40 000) for smokers
# Now I gonna plot (Distribution of age) for patients, most of them are (around 20 years old) and range of data is from (20 to 65 year old)
# What's interesting to notice is that we have patients (below 20 years old), we are gonna plot it on (catplot)
# Trend for smokers and non-smoker (depending on the age) is this same as previous, we have more smokers man and more non-smokers women
# Now we are gonna plot on (Box plot) charges for (18 year old smokers), non-smokers spend less than (5 000)
# But (18 year old smokers) spend from (15 000 - 35 000) for treatment, very similar to older (smokers persons)
# Now we are gonna use (distplot) to see (Distribution of bmi), we can see that (BMI) grow from around (18 to somewhere over 30)
# At around (30 years old it reaches the pick) and start decreasing to age of (50 years old)   
# Next we are gonna see how look charges for persons (with BMI equal or greater than 30), so when BMI reaches the pick
# Persons with (BMI equal or greater than 30) spend the most from (0 to 20 000) then less of them something around (30 000 to 50 000)
# Now we are gonna compare (Distribution of charges for patients with BMI less than 30)
# The most of patients spend from (0 to 10 000) then spends decrease to (30 000)
# The data for persons (BMI greater than 30) is irregular distributed, in case of (Persons with BMI less than 30), data keep the flowing pattern
