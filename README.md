# When we notice linear relationship pattern in our data we can use Linear model to generate predictions
* We can use this in so many cases np: behavior of the stock market, Sports Performance, business growth
* It can be use to examine the differences between features in data, because some kinds of data fits better than others.
* This type of examination is common in scientific tests e.g: role of statistics in clinical trial in the drug approval

# I use it on Medical data to predict charges of patients
* I use various graph plots to explore different features in my data and correlation between them
