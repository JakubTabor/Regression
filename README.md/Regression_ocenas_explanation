# Regression
Regression is very important topic in Machine Learning and I want to exploit it as much as I can
# In this exercise I want to explore the patterns in "ocean dataset" which contain ocean parameters measurement data
# And I want to track correlation between this parameters, then apply "Regression model" to deal with this problem 
# First I load dataset and save it as "bot" and get informations of this data, using "info()"
# Dataset is very big, so I gonna keep only the most important "in my opinion" columns, I lock numbers of this columns
# Then I check informations about my new dataset
# I use "seaborn" to look at (empty values) in my dataset, I can clearly see size of lack values
# Now I gonna deal with it, so I create variable which are my columns and iterate through it getting empty values and save them as "bottle"
