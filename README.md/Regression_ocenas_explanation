# Regression
Regression is very important topic in Machine Learning and I want to exploit it as much as I can
# In this exercise I want to explore the patterns in "ocean dataset" which contain ocean parameters measurement data
# And I want to track correlation between this parameters, then apply "Regression model" to deal with this problem 
# First I load dataset and save it as "bot" and get informations of this data, using "info()"
# Dataset is very big, so I gonna keep only the most important "in my opinion" columns, I lock numbers of this columns
# Then I check informations about my new dataset
# I use "seaborn" to look at (empty values) in my dataset, I can clearly see size of lack values
# Now I gonna deal with it, so I create variable which are my columns and iterate through it getting empty values and save them as "bottle"
# Then I use tehnic "reset_index" on previous saved dataset and set (drop at True), so it gonna drop all empty values
# I plot my dataset one more time and see that empty values are gone
# Now I gonna first build correlations between columns and then visualize them
# I can see the lowest correlation which is (lower number) and the strongest correlation which is (higher number)
# For example (T_degC and O2ml_L) have strong correlation which is (0.8) or (Salnty and Depthm) which is (0.56)
# I also have negative correlation in case of (Depthm and T_degC) which is (- 0.67)
# I plot on graph correlation between (Depth and T_degC) and see that (temperature decrese when depth incrise)
# But there is a strange bump (in range from 0 - 1000 m. depth), we gonna look at it later
# I plot also correlation between (Salnty and Depthm) and see that if (depth increase salinity also increase)
# Now I also want to see correlation between (Salnty and T_degC)
# Distribution of data is very interesting comparing it to other plots, I can use Linear model in this case
# So first I gonna split my data to sets which are (bottle_train and bottle_test) and my dataset is (bottle)
# Then I print shape of my data, to see how complicated is my dataset
# I gonna divide my data into (features which are all columns without T_degC), all of this I gonna convert into list
# My target column will be "T_degC", Now when I have (features and target column) I can split data into (train and test sets)
# I gonna take (X_train and X_test) from (bottle_train of features and only values), its previous splited data by (train_test_split) method
