# Regression
Regression is very important topic in Machine Learning and I want to exploit it as much as I can
# In this exercise I want to explore the patterns in "ocean dataset" which contain ocean parameters measurement data
# And I want to track correlation between this parameters, then apply "Regression model" to deal with this problem 
# First I load dataset and save it as "bot" and get informations of this data, using "info()"
# Dataset is very big, so I gonna keep only the most important "in my opinion" columns, I lock numbers of this columns
# Then I check informations about my new dataset
# I use "seaborn" to look at (empty values) in my dataset, I can clearly see size of lack values
# Now I gonna deal with it, so I create variable which are my columns and iterate through it getting empty values and save them as "bottle"
# Then I use tehnic "reset_index" on previous saved dataset and set (drop at True), so it gonna drop all empty values
# I plot my dataset one more time and see that empty values are gone
# Now I gonna first build correlations between columns and then visualize them
# I can see the lowest correlation which is (lower number) and the strongest correlation which is (higher number)
# For example (T_degC and O2ml_L) have strong correlation which is (0.8) or (Salnty and Depthm) which is (0.56)
