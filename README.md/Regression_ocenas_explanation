# Regression
Regression is very important topic in Machine Learning and I want to exploit it as much as I can
# In this exercise I want to explore the patterns in "ocean dataset" which contain ocean parameters measurement data
# And I want to track correlation between this parameters, then apply "Regression model" to deal with this problem
