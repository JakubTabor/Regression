# I gonna explore dataset that include (renting a bike) depending on some features
# First I drop some columns that are useless for me
# Now I gonna lock my (Hour column at 12) and drop the rest 
# Then I make for loop for (column in index 1 to the last) and plot them on the (scatter plot) 
# They will be named by the label and (Bike_Count) will be visible from the left
