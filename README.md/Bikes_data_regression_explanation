# I gonna explore dataset that include (renting a bike) depending on some features
# First I drop some columns that are useless for me
# Now I gonna lock my (Hour column at 12) and drop the rest 
# Then I make for loop for (column in index 1 to the last) and plot them on the (scatter plot) 
# They will be named by the label and (Bike_Count) will be visible from the left
# The best linear pattern I can see on the (Temperature) plot
# I drop (Wind_speed and Visibility), because they are just messy points
# Now I gonna create (train, val and test sets) using (numpy split) and I split my data at (60% of data and then at 80% of data)
# Then I define function that will return me (X and y), first I make (deepcopy of my dataframe)
# Next I set condition for (x_labels) if is None, I define (X), which is (columns of dataframe that are not y_label) in acces to values
# In else I set condition (if there is x_labels), then my (X) is (x_labels of just that label in dataframe) with reshape to (2D)
# Then in else i specify that (if I have list of specific x_labels), then my X is equal to (dataframe of this x_labels)
