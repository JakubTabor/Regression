# I gonna explore dataset that include (renting a bike) depending on some features
# First I drop some columns that are useless for me
# Now I gonna lock my (Hour column at 12) and drop the rest 
# Then I make for loop for (column in index 1 to the last) and plot them on the (scatter plot) 
# They will be named by the label and (Bike_Count) will be visible from the left
# The best linear pattern I can see on the (Temperature) plot
# I drop (Wind_speed and Visibility), because they are just messy points
# Now I gonna create (train, val and test sets) using (numpy split) and I split my data at (60% of data and then at 80% of data)
# Then I define function that will return me (X and y), first I make (deepcopy of my dataframe)
# Next I set condition for (x_labels) if is None, I define (X), which is (columns of dataframe that are not y_label) in acces to values
# In else I set condition (if there is x_labels), then my (X) is (x_labels of just that label in dataframe) with reshape to (2D)
# Then in else i specify that (if I have list of specific x_labels), then my X is equal to (dataframe of this x_labels)
# Next I specify what is (y), it is (y_label of my datatframe) with reshape to 2D
# And I (stack) both (X and y) horizontally, I save it as a new (data), then I return both (X and y) and new (data)
# Now I gonna use (Temperature) column to create (train, val and test sets), because this column have the best pattern of data
# So I use my (get_xy) fuction and (y label which is Bike_Count) and for (x_labels Temperature(C) column)
# Then I import (LinearRegression) and name it at (temp_reg), because of (Temperature feature)
# and train my model (X_train_temp, y_train_temp) and get pretty low score
# I can see that the dependence of this feature is not so strong, but exist some correlation
# Now I gonna plot my model predictions on (tensorflow linspace), data will be (from -20 to 40) and (100 values from it), i save it as (x)
# To (plt.plot) i put (x variable) and (model : temp_reg.predict this x variable), reshaped into (numpy 2D array)
# And now I can look how my model works on (Temperature(C)) data, its not perfect, but it fits into a pattern
# Now I gonna use all of my features to train the model, so I do as previous (np.split) and get (train, val and test sets)
# I use my function (get_xy) to get (train, val and test) and pass all columns without (Bike_Count) (df.columns[1:])
# I named my model (all_reg) and train it with new all features (X_train_all and y_train_all)
