# [First step: Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Regression_data_preprocessing_0.ipynb)
# In this project i gonna use various techniques to first preprocess it, then remove outliers and take care of the data distribution

* Various plots will gonna help me see what is the percentage of outliers in data and how my data is distributed
* Especially we are looking for columns with normal distribution (gaussian columns)
* And techniques of replacing outliers rather than removing them

# I write some functions for data preprocessing
* Function that deal with column (right image) and return three different columns that interpreted same data

# And function which deals with geography column

* And function for one hot encoding
# Next i write the function that identify gaussian columns
* But i have only one normally distibuted column
* I also write the function that shows me rest of the columns that are skewed, so they are not normally distributed
