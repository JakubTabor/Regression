# [First step: Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Regression_data_preprocessing_0.ipynb)
# In this project i gonna use various techniques to first preprocess it, then remove outliers and take care of the data distribution
* Various plots will gonna help me see what is the percentage of outliers in data and how my data is distributed
* Especially we are looking for columns with normal distribution (gaussian columns)
