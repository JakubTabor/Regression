# In this section i gonna use Regression model on my already preprocessed data
* First i write a function that will build correlation between columns and return columns with more than 80% correlation

# I gonna use it on my cupped data, it will help my model figure out the most significant features from my data 
* Then I use sklearn to split my data into train and test sets, i write it in form of function and use it on my dataset

# I define my OLS model and add a constant to my X_train set
* It means that every row in this columns will be multiplied with bias equal one

# Next in my function i define model training with y_train and changed X_train
