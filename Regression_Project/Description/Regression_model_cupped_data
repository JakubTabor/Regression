# In this section i gonna use Regression model on my already preprocessed data
* First i write a function that will build correlation between columns and return columns with more than 80% correlation
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Images/correlation_function.png)

# I gonna use it on my cupped data, it will help my model figure out the most significant features from my data 
* Then I use sklearn to split my data into train and test sets, i write it in form of function and use it on my dataset

# I define my OLS model and add a constant to my X_train set
* It means that every row in this columns will be multiplied with bias equal one

# Next in my function i define model training with y_train and changed X_train
* And then i call object of my class and train OLS model on my data

# I call summary of my model, now i gonna extract the most important informations
* Which are p-value, r-squared value, adjusted r-squared value
* Now i write function to get significant variable, to accomplish it I reject null hypothesis
* And set p-value threshold at 0.5, when i get less than 0.5 it means that it is significant variable

# Then i call my function and use it on my Linear Regression model
* I must add constant to my X_train and use my model function
* to train it on significant variables of X_train and just y_train

# Finally i call summary of my model and i get only the most important measurment and reduce complexity
