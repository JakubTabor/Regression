# I gonna use Regression model on Cancer data 
* First I check my data distribution and look if there are any outliers, to do this i use histplot
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Images/Histogram_death_rate.png)
* We can see the data that is placed apart from most of the distribution

# I also check distiobution of the data on boxplot
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Images/Boxplot_death_rate.png)
* We can see outliers above and below the (upper and lower fences)

# Then I am searching for columns with single or few values and duplicates and data and deal with all of them
* I have complicated column (bindIng), so I write the function that will remove brackets and split values, take a mean and remove remaining column

# Then I deal with (Geography) column, because it have two variables with comma, I need to split them and save in different columns
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Images/categ_to_col_function.png)

# I write also function that will take categorical (object) columns and convert them into encoded, numerical columns
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Images/one_hot_encoding_function.png)

# Then i deal with missing values, it will drop columns with more than 50% of missing values, but if columns have less than 50% it will fill missing values with mean value
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Images/drop_and_fill_function.png)

# Now we are gonna extract gaussian columns from our dataset
* After rejection of null hipotesis we are searching for columns that significance is greater than 0.5
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Images/gaussian_columns.png)
* We are gonna use Z-Score technique to detect outliers and also look at normally distributed columns

# I write function that will define outliers and extract columns without them
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Images/deal_with_outliers.png)
* Then i gonna remove categorical columns with less than 10 unique values

# Next I gonna identify columns that have skewed distribution and plot them on graph
![(https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Images/identify_skewed_function.png)
* I use boxplot to see all outliers in my data
* We can see that we have bunch of them

# Then i define upper and lower limit using quantile method
![](https://github.com/JakubTabor/Regression/blob/main/Regression_Project/Images/quantile_upper_lower_limit.png)
* Using this method i write function that will return me columns with outliers

# Now I can use Trimming or cupping method to detect and remove outliers
* I choose cupping method to not loos so many informations
* This technique replace outliers with max and min allowed

# When I plot my data of graph i can see that all outliers are gone, my data is ready
