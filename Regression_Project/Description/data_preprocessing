# I gonna use Regression model on Cancer data 
* First I check my data distribution and look if there are any outliers, to do this i use histplot and Boxplot

# Then I am searching for columns with single or few values and duplicates and data and deal with all of them
* I have complicated column (bindIng), so I write the function that will remove brackets and split values, take a mean and remove remaining column
* Then I deal with (Geography) column, because it have two variables with comma, I need to split them and save in different columns
* I write also function that will take categorical (object) columns and convert them into encoded, numerical columns
